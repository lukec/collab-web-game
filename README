This is a collaborative web game for groups of people.

One person runs the web server on a machine connected to a projector, so everyone can see the game board.

  > ./bin/run-server --game pixel

They then point their web interface at the /show URL.

The other players connect to the Host & port displayed on the screen, and then interact with the page.

The player's state is stored on the server and displayed. The players try to collectively produce something non-random.
